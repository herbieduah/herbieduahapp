**This is a very personal project and was never meant for public eyes so please excuse my terrible coding practices and commits.**<br />

This is project was designed... by coding meaning there was no Mockup or boilerplate to go off for the project.
<br />

The project had to be refactored several times as major design changes were made... please don't try this at home (it sucked, it really sucked... always go by a mock up..).
