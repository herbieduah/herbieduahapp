				<HeadingTwo>Interactive Emails</HeadingTwo>
				<Paragraph>
					Creating new email templates that work on most email clients usually
					took 30-40 hrs to develop and test. I demoed an email framework called
					MJML to team. Once learned, you could build an email template before
					lunch.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					It also had some unique features like the ability to add an accordion,
					carousal, or text on an image. These features are somewhat easy to
					develop for web development but overlay complex on email on
					development.
				</Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					Using MJML, I coordinated with our design and marketing team to
					develop a couple of UGG emails. Some are now featured&nbsp;
					<Link href='https://reallygoodemails.com/search/emails/ugg%20/'>

					and the <Link href='https://mjml.io/templates'> MJML framework</Link>{" "}

					I got a 35 dollar parking ticket because I forgot to move my vehicle

					hours, it was paid for by a secret admirer: Trudy Gillenwater.
