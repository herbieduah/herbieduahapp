						Creating new email templates that work on most email clients usually

						It also had some unique features like the ability to add an
						accordion, carousal, or text on an image. These features are
						somewhat easy to develop for web development but overly complex on

						Using MJML, I coordinated with our design and marketing team to
						develop a couple of UGG emails. Some are now featured&nbsp;
