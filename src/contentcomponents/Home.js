							On average, I receive about 5 LinkedIn InMessage messages a week.
							I've usually being ignoring most of them but I recently heard
							there is a cost to you guys for un-answered messages and I feel
							terribly sorry about that. I customized part of my porfolio to
							give you a better understanding of my skills or what I want.

						I am Phoenix based a Web developer/designer with five years of

						In the future, I believe everyone is going to have their own app. I
						imagine it will be a mixture between the data and features from all
						your social media apps all merged in an app with the help of Machine
						Learning.Â I envision every user having a different experience with
						your app, just like they do in real life. The idea of everyone
						having their own app was the main inspiration for the look and feel
						of this web app.
